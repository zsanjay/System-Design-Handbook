![What happens when you type a URL into your browser](https://github.com/zsanjay/Obsidian-Notes/blob/main/assets%2Fimages%2F20241211115607.png)


1. **Browser parses the URL**  
- The browser identifies the components: scheme (https), domain (example. com), and path (/hello-world).  

  
2. **DNS lookup**  
- The browser checks its cache or queries a DNS resolver (ISP or public DNS like Googleâ€™s [8.8.8.8](http://8.8.8.8/)) to translate the domain name into an IP address.  
- If not cached, the resolver performs a recursive DNS lookup, contacting root, TLD, and authoritative name servers.  

  
3. **Establishing a connection**  
- A TCP connection is initiated between the browser and the server at the resolved IP address.  
- If the URL uses HTTPS, a TLS handshake is performed to encrypt the connection.  

  
4. **Sending the HTTP request**  
- The browser sends an HTTP request with details like method (GET/POST), headers (e.g., User-Agent), and optional body data.  
- Example: GET /hello-world HTTP/1.1.  
  
5. **Server processes the request**  
- The server identifies the resource from the request path and processes it.  
- For dynamic content, the server might query a database, run application logic, and generate the response on the fly.  
  
6. **Returning the response**  
- The server responds with:  
- Status Line: Indicates success or failure (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).  
- Headers: Metadata like Content-Type (e.g., text/html) and caching instructions.  
- Body: The requested content (e.g., HTML, JSON, or image data).  
  
7. **Browser renders the content**  
- The browser parses the HTML and makes additional requests for linked resources (e.g., CSS, JS, images).  
- Resources are rendered progressively, and JavaScript is executed to enhance interactivity.  
  
8. **Caching and Optimization**  
- Browsers cache resources based on headers like Cache-Control.  
- CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) and edge servers may serve static content to reduce latency.  
  
Key Points for additional benefit:  
- Mention DNS caching at various layers (browser, OS, ISP).  
- Highlight the TLS handshake and its role in securing HTTPS connections.  
- Discuss CDNs and how they improve performance.  
- Touch on asynchronous resource loading (e.g., defer or async for scripts).  
- Bring up response codes and their significance (e.g., '200' - Ok, '301' - Permanent Redirect, '503' - Service Unavailable).
